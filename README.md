A react-native counter app, that keeps track of the pace of clicks per hour.

## Purpose
The purpose of this app is to allow assemblers/manufactuers to keep track
of their count and pace of production. (Also this is part of me learning 
react-native for a school project).

### Details
The app can be run using react native. In order to do so, you will need to
have the react-native cli installed. 

React Native Environment Setup(https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

### Planned Improvements
* Allow users to change pace unit
* Change button sizes to feel more natural
* Add reset button in top menu bar
* Add decrement button
* Add indicator to show last button pressed
